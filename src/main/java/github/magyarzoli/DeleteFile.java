     * {@code delete} method that takes a functional interface {@code FileFunctional} as a parameter. This functional
     * interface seems to have a single abstract method called {@code fileFunctional()}.
     * <ul>
     *     <li>This indicates that the method has a default implementation in the interface. Default methods were
     *     introduced in Java 8 and allow adding new methods to an interface without breaking the existing implementations
     *     of that interface.</li>
     *     <li>This means the method does not return any value; it performs some action.</li>
     *     <li>The method takes an instance of the functional interface {@code FileFunctional} as a parameter named
     *     {@code functional}.</li>
     *     <li>The method calls the abstract method {@code fileFunctional()} on the provided instance of {@code FileFunctional}.
     *     Since {@code FileFunctional} is a functional interface, it is expected to have a single abstract method, which
     *     is implemented by the calling code outside of this method.</li>
     * </ul>
     * The purpose of the {@code delete} method is to provide a mechanism for executing code provided by the caller
     * through the {@code FileFunctional} interface. The implementation of the {@code fileFunctional()} method can contain
     * custom logic for file deletion or file-related operations. By calling the {@code delete} method with an instance of
     * {@code FileFunctional}, the caller can effectively execute their custom code within the context of the
     * {@code delete} method.
     * @param       functional lambda function.
     * @throws      IOException if the named file exists but is a directory rather than a regular file, does not exist
     *              but cannot be created, or cannot be opened for any other reason
